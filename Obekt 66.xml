    <review> The 159 is way ahead of previous Alfas in terms of reliability and build quality,
        although it’s still behind key rivals. Time after time our Driver Power surveys have
        highlighted the fact that the brand trails its German rivals on quality. But lower prices go
        some way towards making up for that. Inconsistent dealer service can be an issue, but a good
        independent specialist can transform the ownership experience. Despite Alfa’s reputation for
        sportiness, the 159 isn’t that fast. Refinement and equipment levels are good, though. If
        you’re buying with your head, you probably won’t be tempted – but if you’re buying with your
        heart, the 159 makes sense. If you’re in the market for an executive model, you don’t
        necessarily have to buy something sober and German. Instead, you could opt for an Italian
        car with sporting flair. </review>
